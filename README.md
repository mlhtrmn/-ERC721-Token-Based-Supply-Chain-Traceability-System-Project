# -ERC721-Token-Based-Supply-Chain-Traceability-System-Project
I propose a blockchain-based, decentralized supply chain management system based on smart contracts. In order to provide comprehensive provenance information to consumers and producers, I maintain the relationship between resources and products in manufacturing processes. The concept is based on two key ideas: representing physical goods in the form of digital tokens, and recipes that enable their transformation. Additional functionality like certifying goods, transferring, splitting and combining tokens facilitates cross-business traceability.
